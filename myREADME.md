# Henry's JIRA Chrome extension

**Review**

This project was a great challenge and experience for me as a programmer. Until now I had never worked on a chrome browser extension and this project was a great review of DOM manipulation methods and building an app without a front end framework (although I did implement Jquery for ajax over xhr).

In addition, the use of promises and nested callback functions were interesting challenges as well. I also got hung up on formatting the getJiraQueryResults url correct but after a little research and debugging I was able to figure it out.

All in all this was a challenging and interesting project, and shows that I'm capable of writing a dynamic application that utilizes APIs without a front end framework.
